# Always Sunrise

Always Sunrise is a Django web app that determines where a sunrise is occuring and plays the closest livestream to that location. It can be found at [hon.pythonanywhere.com](http://hon.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Servers

Always Sunrise is hosted by PythonAnywhere. To run commands on the PythonAnywhere server you will need to open a Bash console in the virtual environment. To do so, in the PythonAnywhere dashboard, go to "Web apps" and click on "Start a console in this virtualenv".
